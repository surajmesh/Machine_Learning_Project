\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I am indebted to \textbf{Prof.\ Jayaram N.\ Chengalur, Prof.\ Mihir Arjunwadkar} and \textbf{Dr.\ Niruj Mohan Ramanujam} for their guidance on a daily basis during this project. I am thankful to 
Prof.\ Jayaram for sharing his own software for reading FITS files which made my work much 
easier than it would have otherwise been. Special thanks to Dr.\ Niruj Mohan Ramanujam 
for arranging several lectures on Radio Interferometry, specifically for me, despite his 
busy schedule. Prof.\ Mihir Arjunwadkar supported me a great deal on analysis and design 
of algorithms. I am also thankful to all of them for sharing their own wonderful reference 
articles with me and making me capable enough of carrying out such work independently in the 
future.

I would like to convey my utmost gratitude to National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, 
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR) for supporting my project and 
providing me with a wonderful working environment. 

I hereby thank to Dr.\ Sheelan Chowdhury for being my internal guide
and also all individuals from whom i benefited directly or indirectly.

Last but not the least i would like to thank my friends Rossi D'Souza, Sarvesh Nikumbh,  
Dinesh Mali and Ankit Dangi for their encouragement and help during my tenure at CMS and NCRA.
